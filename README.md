# CactusOS
A simple operating system made for fun.

# Note
Currently CactusOS is being re-developed because it was missing some essential things.
For example paging had not been implemented and it would take a lot of work to implement it in the current version.
The kernel is planned to be excecuted on the higher half so that procceses can have 3g available.
For more info on a higher half kernel visit: https://wiki.osdev.org/Higher_Half_Kernel.
The procces of creating the kernel again could take a couple months.
